# syntheis_final
This is our (212101745-212234140) final project in course number 236347.
To instal the dependecies please run:
    
      pip install -r requirements.txt

We implemented additional features 2,4 and 5.
2 - loop unrolling, we unrolled each loop 7 times.
4 - GUI- we implemented one:
  To use the GUI just run src/IDE/main.py. 
  Below are images taken during the use of the IDE

5 - Expression - we extended our synthesizer to support expressions in the solutions.
Note: we supplied benchmarks. they can be found in the  src/while_lang/benchmarks.py. just run this file to run the benchmarks. note that the test may fail due to the uncertainty of Z3, but the new results will also be correct.
